      "ingredients": [
        "vegetable oil, for frying",
        "¾ cup  all-purpose flour (95 g)",
        "¾ cup  cornmeal, fine-grind (110 g)",
        "2 ½ teaspoons  sugar",
        "1 ½ teaspoons  baking powder",
        "1 ½ teaspoons  kosher salt",
        "2 teaspoons  McCormick® Jazzy Spice Blend",
        "4 tablespoons  unsalted butter, (1/2 stick) cubed and chilled",
        "1 large egg, beaten",
        "1 cup  buttermilk (240 mL)",
        "1 jalapeño, seeded and finely chopped",
        "½ small yellow onion, finely chopped"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Fill a medium pot with 4 inches (10 cm) of oil and heat over medium heat to 350˚F (180˚C).",
        "In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, salt, and Jazzy spice blend.",
        "Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, add the butter and work into the flour mixture until it resembles a coarse meal and the butter pieces are no larger than peas.",
        "Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the egg and buttermilk. Working from the center outward, gradually mix into the dry ingredients until a smooth batter forms. Add the jalapeño and onion and mix gently just to incorporate. Be careful not to overmix.",
        "Working in batches, use a 1-ounce (28 G) ice cream scoop or tablespoon to quickly but carefully scoop 8-10 balls of batter into the hot oil. Adjust the heat to maintain the oil temperature. Cook, turning the hush puppies frequently with a slotted spoon or spider, until golden brown and puffy, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a rack lined with paper towels to drain and repeat with the rest of the batter."
