Pick up the disk and let it drape over the backs of your hands, letting gravity help you stretch it into a 12-14\" circle. If the dough resists, let it relax for a few minutes, then try again. Place the stretched dough on a peel (or overturned cookie sheet or cutting board) that's lightly dusted with semolina or other type of flour.  Scatter the mozzarella on top of the dough, then the corn and tomatoes. Drizzle the whole pizza with a small amount of olive oil, and a sprinkling of salt. Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone in your oven, and bake ~7-10 minutes, until the crust browns and the cheese melts.  Remove the pizza from the oven, and let cool for a moment (if you're making one pizza, you can leave it on the stone, otherwise I like to transfer to a rack, or just slide a knife or such between the peel/cutting board and the pie, to let the steam vent so it doesn't soften itself). Transfer to a cutting board if you haven't already, and scatter on the basil. Slice and serve."},{"title":"Char Sui Glazed Duck Legs","img":"https://www.pws-cdn.com/the-recipe-depository/category/duck.jpg","ingredient":"4 duck legs Salt and pepper Chinese 5 spice powder 1/4 cup char sui sauce, thinned with a little water","instruction":"Season the duck legs with salt, pepper and the  5 spice powder and set aside for at least an hour.
