		"ingredient": "6 oz penne  1 tbsp evoo 2 scallions, green and white parts, thinly sliced 1/2 tbsp sage, finely chopped 5 oz baby spinach 1 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into cubes  2/3 cup fresh ricotta cheese 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving s&p",
		"instruction": "Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, until nearly al dente (drain the pasta 1 minute short of al dente). Drain the pasta thoroughly, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.   Meanwhile, in a large deep skillet, heat the evoo. Add the scallions and sage and cook over moderately-high heat until lightly browned and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the spinach and cook, stirring, until wilted. Add the pasta, butter and ricotta and toss until combined. Add 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta cooking water and the parm-reg. Season generously with s&p. Cook over moderately low heat, tossing, until the sauce is thick and creamy, adding more of the pasta water as needed.

		"title": "Corn, Cherry Tomato and Basil Pizza",
		"img": "https://www.pws-cdn.com/the-recipe-depository/uploads/1218-corn-cherry-tomato-and-basil-pizza-1444593941.jpg",
		"ingredient": "1 ball of pizza dough, ~10 oz  semolina or regular flour for dusting 1/4-1/3 lb mozarella, shredded kernels shaved off 1 ear of corn 2 dozen small cherry tomatoes (preferably Sungold), sliced in half olive oil coarse salt 1 handful basil leaves, torn if large",
		"instruction": "Place the pizza dough on a lightly-floured counter top, and press outward into a thick disk (leaving a 1\" unpressed area along the edge as the crust). Pick up the disk and let it drape over the backs of your hands, letting gravity help you stretch it into a 12-14\" circle. If the dough resists, let it relax for a few minutes, then try again. Place the stretched dough on a peel (or overturned cookie sheet or cutting board) that's lightly dusted with semolina or other type of flour.  Scatter the mozzarella on top of the dough, then the corn and tomatoes. Drizzle the whole pizza with a small amount of olive oil, and a sprinkling of salt. Slide the pizza onto the preheated stone in your oven, and bake ~7-10 minutes, until the crust browns and the cheese melts.  Remove the pizza from the oven, and let cool for a moment (if you're making one pizza, you can leave it on the stone, otherwise I like to transfer to a rack, or just slide a knife or such between the peel/cutting board and the pie, to let the steam vent so it doesn't soften itself). Transfer to a cutting board if you haven't already, and scatter on the basil. Slice and serve."

		"title": "Midnight Asparagus with Creamy Eggs",
		"img": "https://www.pws-cdn.com/the-recipe-depository/uploads/1858-midnight-asparagus-with-creamy-eggs.jpg",
		"ingredient": "1 1/4 pounds asparagus-tough ends removed, chopped into 1 1/2-inch pieces,  2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil,  1/4 medium onion- diced, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper, 4 large eggs, 1 tablespoon juice from 1 lemon 4 slices crusty bread",
		"instruction": "Adjust the oven rack so that it is about 5 inches below the broiler. Turn on the broiler, and let it preheat for a couple minutes. Add the oil to a 12-inch oven-proof skillet and place the pan under the broiler for two minutes. The oil and pan should be hot, but not smoking.  Carefully remove the pan and add the asparagus and onion. Stir well to coat the pieces in the oil. Replace the skillet and close the door. Cook until the asparagus and onion are lightly browned, but not mushy, three to four minutes, making sure to stir halfway through.  Remove the skillet and push the onions and asparagus to the sides of the skillet so that the center is empty. Crack the eggs carefully into the center of the skillet. Return the skillet to the broiler and close the door. Cook until the whites are set, but the yolks are still runny, about one minute.  When done, turn off the broiler, and remove the pan. Drizzle the lemon juice on top, and season to taste with salt and pepper. You can eat straight from the pan, or divide the contents between to plates. Serve with the slices of crusty bread"

		"title": "Chilaquiles with Pepitas, Charred Corn and Black Beans",
		"img": "https://www.pws-cdn.com/the-recipe-depository/uploads/1799-chilaquiles-with-pepitas-charred-corn-and-black-beans.jpg",
		"ingredient": "1 tablespoon vegetable oil  1 ear corn, kernels removed 8 oz tortilla chips (we used multigrain, but the recipe originally called for corn tortilla chips) 1 cup canned black beans (about half of a 14-ounce can), drained and rinsed 1 avocado, thinly sliced 1 small onion, thinly sliced, slices placed in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro 1/2 cup toasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas) crumbled cotija cheese",
		"instruction": "Preheat broiler to high. Place tomatillos, garlic, onion, and pepper on a foil-lined heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet. Broil without moving until well charred on top side, about 15 minutes. Flip vegetables with a spatula and continue broiling until well-charred and completely softened, about 15 minutes longer (ours didn't take nearly this long to char and soften, but then again, maybe we under-charred).   Transfer vegetables to a food processor and allow to cool for a few minutes.  Add cilantro and lime juice.  Process until roughly pureed. Season salsa verde to taste with kosher salt and set aside.   Heat oil in a medium skillet over high heat until smoking. Add corn kernels, toss to coat, and cook without moving until charred on one side. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally until well charred all over, about 6 minutes total. Add black beans.  Season to taste with kosher salt and remove from heat.  Heat 1 1/2 cups salsa verde and 1 cup water in a large saucepan until simmering. Add tortilla chips and fold with a rubber spatula until all the chips are coated. Transfer chips to a large serving dish or individual serving plates. Top with charred corn, black beans, avocado slices, sliced onion, chopped cilantro, toasted pumpkin seeds and cotija cheese.   Serve immediately with additional salsa verde."
